**Building AI Course Project**

A fast, privacy-first Depth of Field (DOF) calculator for photographers and filmmakers.  
Runs entirely in your browser, works offline, and never sends any data online.  
It helps visualize how aperture, focal length, focus distance, and sensor size affect depth of field and framing — perfect for planning shots on set or in the field.

## Summary
For photographers and filmmakers who want to quickly evaluate depth of field while shooting or planning, without relying on external services or apps.

## How it works

## Privacy
No cookies, no tracking — all calculations happen on your device.
