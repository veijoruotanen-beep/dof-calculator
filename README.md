# DOF Calculator  
*Final project for the Building AI course*  

## 🧠 1. Idea in a nutshell  
**DOF Calculator** is a browser-based tool for photographers and filmmakers who want to quickly evaluate depth of field (DOF) while shooting or planning — without relying on any external services.  
The tool runs entirely in your browser, works offline, and never sends or stores any data online.  

## 🌍 2. Background  
Depth of field control is one of the key elements in visual storytelling, yet most existing calculators require an internet connection or display ads.  
When shooting in remote locations or studios without connectivity, this can be a real issue.  

**This project solves the problem by providing:**  
- A fast, accurate DOF calculator that works fully offline  
- Total privacy — no tracking, no cloud storage, no analytics  
- A simple, clear interface optimized for both mobile and desktop browsers  

🎯 **Motivation:**  
The need came from my own production work: I often wanted to check DOF quickly on set without using third-party services. This project empowers creators to plan and shoot independently, with privacy and reliability.  

## 🤖 3. Data and AI techniques  
The current version is purely physics-based and doesn’t rely on external datasets.  
All calculations happen locally in JavaScript using optical principles, including:  
- Aperture (f-stop)  
- Focal length  
- Focus distance  
- Sensor size  

**Possible future AI extensions:**  
- EXIF-based AI suggestions for ideal DOF settings  
- Machine-learning analysis of lens behavior and sharpness zones  
- Depth-map estimation from sample photos to visualize focus range  

## 🎬 4. How it’s used  
The DOF Calculator is designed for:  
- **Photographers and filmmakers** planning shots in the field  
- **Students and teachers** learning optical theory and camera behavior  
- **Pre-production planners** during storyboarding and scene setup  

💡 **Benefits:**  
- Works anywhere — no installation, no connection needed  
- 100% privacy and transparency  
- Accessible to professionals and enthusiasts alike

## ⚠️ 5. Challenges  
**Limitations:**  
- Does not simulate lens character, vignetting, or sensor noise  
- Does not replace creative judgment or real test shots  
- AI features are still conceptual at this stage  

**Ethical aspects:**  
No user data is collected, transmitted, or stored. The project is fully privacy-safe and open for educational use.  

## 🚀 6. Next steps  
**Potential future development:**  
- AI-assisted DOF simulation with visual focus previews  
- Automatic EXIF analysis and setting recommendations  
- Integration with photo metadata tools like Lightroom or Capture One  

To continue development, collaboration with optical engineers and photographers would be valuable, as well as contributions from the open-source AI community.
